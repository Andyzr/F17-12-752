# How to get data here...
This folder is where I save data for lectures. However, instead of pushing the datasets directly into our git repository (since the datasets are large and git was not meant to be used as a file server), this folder is kept empty in there. To get your own copy of the datasets, go to Canvas and under the files you will find *Datasets*.
